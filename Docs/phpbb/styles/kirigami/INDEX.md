Introduction
-----

Kirigami, the September 2012 phpBB3 club style release, is the first responsive RocketTheme phpBB3 style built in conjuction with the RokBB3. A responsive design adapts itself to a particular viewing environment such as desktop or mobile, without the need for separate layouts for varying platforms.

### Responsive Layout

Kirigami's responsive grid system is designed for desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Each with minor modifications to enhance compatibility in each mode.

We base our responsive layout on Twitter's Bootstrap Framework, with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.
