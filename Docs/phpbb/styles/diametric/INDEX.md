Diametric, the May 2012 phpBB club release, is a beautifully layered style with a distinct panel-based design, using the powerful ColorChooser system. The template has integrated styling for a range of popular RocketTheme interfaces, such as RokTabs, RokNewspager, and RokNewsFlash -- allowing for maximum visual and structural flexibility.
