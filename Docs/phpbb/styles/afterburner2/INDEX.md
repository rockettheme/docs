Introduction
-----

Afterburner2 is an experiment in how streamlined a RokBB Framework Style can be, whilst still being visually enticing and usable on a live site. This style is perfect for sites where performance is key. A wide set of control options are also available.

### WebFonts Imageset and Icons

![][webfonts]

Afterburner2 supports WebFonts-based scalable vector icons. No images are used in this style. All icons and imagesets have been converted into sprites. This adds some new indicators (poll icon, unapproved icon, etc.) in addition to other useful features. 

For example: Installing matching language imagesets is not needed as we removed text and replaced it with pictographic language.

### RokBridge Support

![][rokbridge]

RokBridge is a non-invasive, bi-directional bridge for Joomla and the forum platform phpBB. 

By following a few simple steps, you can easily integrate the two platforms, providing registration, user syncing, and syncing of login sessions. RokBridge comes with three default modules: Login, Latest Post, and Member. Please visit the [RokBridge product page][rokbridge] for support and latest news.

### Responsive Layout
