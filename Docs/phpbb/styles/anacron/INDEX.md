Introduction
-----

Anacron is a vibrant, highly adaptable and engaging style, ideal for a vast selection of possible forums, from community to business. Subtle visual elements in the sectioned design, add character and division to the structure, without compromising on content focus.

NOTE: **RokBB 5.0.4+** is required for Anacron to work correctly. For more details on installing RokBB, please visit the [Administrative Module installation guide](../../start/styles.md#installing-administrative-modules). Also, this style presently only supports phpBB 3.0 and is not currently available for phpBB 3.1.


### WebFonts Imageset and Icons

Anacron supports WebFonts-based scalable vector icons. No images are used in this style. All icons and imagesets have been converted into sprites. This adds some new indicators (poll icon, unapproved icon, etc.) in addition to other useful features. 

For example: Installing matching language imagesets is not needed as we removed text and replaced it with pictographic language.

### RokBridge Support

RokBridge is a non-invasive, bi-directional bridge for Joomla and the forum platform phpBB. 

By following a few simple steps, you can easily integrate the two platforms, providing registration, user syncing, and syncing of login sessions. RokBridge comes with three default modules: Login, Latest Post, and Member. Please visit the [RokBridge product page][rokbridge] for support and latest news.

### Responsive Layout

Anacron's responsive grid system is designed for desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Each with minor modifications to enhance compatibility in each mode.
