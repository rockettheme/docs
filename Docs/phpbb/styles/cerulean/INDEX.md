### RokBridge Support

RokBridge is an attempt to bring back famous component into the newest Joomla 2.5/3.x environment. RokBridge is a non-invasive, bi-directional bridge for Joomla and the forum platform phpBB. 

By following a few simple steps, you can easily integrate the two platforms, providing registration, user syncing, and syncing of login sessions. RokBridge comes with three default modules: Login, Latest Post, and Member. Please visit the [RokBridge product page][rokbridge] for support and latest news.

### 9 Styled and 25 Structural Content Suffixes

Similar to the Joomla version of Cerulean, there are 9 stylistic module class suffixes that add a unique style variation to the modules. These include: **box1-5** and **title1-4**

Additionally, there are 25 structural suffixes which affect the layout and metrics of the modules. You can apply variations using RokBB framework. Suffixes can be applied to the forum categories list, forum topics list, forum posts list and various modules. Extensive CSS styling gives user an ability to completely redesign the forum look, and achieve even the most sophisticated results.
