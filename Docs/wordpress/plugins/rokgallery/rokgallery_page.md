Introduction
-----
RokGallery Pages in WordPress act as full-page galleries you can use to highlight your images in a way a widget might not be able to. Instead of making the gallery appear as part of a larger page, you can easily create a new page that puts your images center stage while maintaining your sidebar and widget positions.

Creating a New Gallery Page
-----
![][page1]

The first step to creating a gallery page is to access the **RokGallery Pages** tool accessible from your administrative sidebar. You can create a new gallery by selecting **Add New** in either the sidebar or next to the RokGallery title in the main **RokGallery Pages** configuration screen. This screen (pictured above) will list any gallery pages you've already created.

>> Gallery pages and tag galleries are handled differently by RokGallery. Creating a tag gallery makes image slice properties easily accessible while creating a gallery page has more in common with a widget. You apply tag galleries to gallery pages and RokGallery widgets. 

### Gallery Selection and Options
The **Gallery Selection and Options** tab enables you to select a tag gallery to assign to the page, as well as configure some of the more common options for the page. If there is one required tab for the page creation process, this would be it.
