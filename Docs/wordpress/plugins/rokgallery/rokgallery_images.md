Image Editing in RokGallery
-----
RokGallery isn't a full-fledged image editing solution, but it can be used to crop and resize images so that they fit within your site's layout. Because RokGallery preserves the original image, these edits are saved separately and referred to as slices. A single image in RokGallery can have as many slices as you need to fit various RokGallery widgets placed in your site. These slices can be created by the RokGallery Image Editor and further refined using the Slice Editor.

### RokGallery Image Editor

The RokGallery Image Editor is available to you from within the RokGallery component administration interface found in **Admin -> RokGallery Admin**. By clicking on an image's edit icon **(1)**, a panel appears which gives you direct access to the image's title, slug (URL-friendly title), description, tags, and its slices.

    2. **Title** This field allows you to adjust the image's title as needed. [46%, 1%]
    3. **Slug** This field is for the url-friendly slug for the image, replacing spaces with dashes. This field is automatically generated by RokGallery, however you can change it as needed. [59%, 1%]

    5. **Tags** You can add and remove tags to the particular image in this area. [46%, 29%]
    6. **Slices** This area of the Image Editor is where you can access the Slice Editor to create new slices, edit existing ones, generate a sharable link to a slice, or delete the slice. The Admin Thumbnail is a default slice used on the administrative side of RokGallery to display the image on the backend and can not be deleted. [46%, 57%]

    5. **Width and Height** This option allows you to set a specific width and height for the selection area. This option is disabled on administrative slices. Once applied, the selected area is cropped to become the new or edited slice. [39%, 40%]
    6. **Size** The size settings allows you to do a simple resize of the image. You can adjust these settings even when there is a lock icon over the numbers, but changes will only be completed upon hitting the **Apply** button. This isn't an option on administrative slices. [39%, 52%]

    9. **Thumbnail** This option sets the thumbnail size for the slice as it would appear in any gallery displays that require a thumbnail. Additionally, these settings are used on the administrative end to display the slice in the Image Editor. [8%, 65%]

The Slice Editor gives you the ability to edit (or create) individual slices used in various gallery widgets and pages of your site. These slices are independent copies of the original images, and as such, any changes you make in the Slice Editor only affect the individual slice.
