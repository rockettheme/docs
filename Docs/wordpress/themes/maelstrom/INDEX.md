![][scrolling]

Scrolling Positions is a feature of Gantry, which, when activated, modifies the behaviour of stacked widgets. Instead of appearing vertically, the additional widgets become accessible via a javascript transition button for the Showcase, Feature, or Bottom Widget rows.

### Widget Variations

Maelstrom has 31 inbuilt suffixes with 25 stylistic suffixes. These can be combined to create a diverse range of widget styles. You can see how the widget styles can be portrayed on the demo via the Core Features > Widget Variations page.
