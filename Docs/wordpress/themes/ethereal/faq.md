What is Gantry?
-----

[Gantry][gantry] is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTheme theme. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of WordPress.

Can I install RocketLauncher onto an existing WordPress website?
-----

No. RocketLauncher will install both WordPress and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh WordPress installation.

I installed Ethereal RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.
-----

To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
