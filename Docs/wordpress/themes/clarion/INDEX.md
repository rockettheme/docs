Introduction

Clarion is a subtle, conservatively styled design, that is primed for business use, whilst still providing a platform for flexibility, in terms of structure, layout and style possibilities. It is the perfect base for individualization, exemplified by its user friendly interface.

* PHP 5.2.17+ (5.3+ recommended)
* MySQL 5.0.4 or higher
* WordPress 3.2+, 4.0+
* Gantry 4 Framework
* FF, Safari, Chrome, Opera, IE8+

>> NOTE: An updated version of RokCommon is required for Clarion to work properly. For more details on the Gantry Framework, please visit its [Dedicated Website][gantry].

### Image Overlays

![][overlays]

Custom styling is used for content images and RokGallery grid images to complement the conservative design. A bolded white border with a box shadow is added for a subtle effect. RokGallery also benefits from a cornered overlay on hover.

### Mobile Theme

![][mobile]

Clarion is available in a fixed layout, with a separate mobile layout for iPhone and Android devices. These mobile layouts can be configured via our Gantry admin. We also include a set of position aliases that provide you additional control over your mobile content.
