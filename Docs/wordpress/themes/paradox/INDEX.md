Scrolling Positions is a feature of Gantry, which, when activated, modifies the behaviour of stacked widgets. Instead of appearing vertically, the additional widgets become accessible via a button for the Top, Showcase, Feature or Bottom Widget rows.

### Fusion Menu

There are two menu options, SplitMenu and Fusion Menu. The Splitmenu is a static menu system that displays select menu items in a main horizontal menu. The Fusion Menu is an advanced, CSS based menu system, which offers a wide range of per menu options.
