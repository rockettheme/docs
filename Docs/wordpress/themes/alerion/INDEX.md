### Responsive Layout

![][responsive]

Alerion's responsive grid system is designed for desktop, tablet and smartphone systems, each with minor modifications to ensure compatibility in each mode.

We use the responsive layout based on Twitter's Bootstrap Framework, with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.

### QuickNav and Floating Module

![][quicknav]

QuickNav adds a scrolling menu that follows your viewport as you scroll. You can set an icon with FontAwesome icon format.

The Floating Module feature that allows you to 'bounce' a widget between the template sections. You can set a starting position and the end position for the widget, as well as the stopping offset point. The stopping offset will stop the widget in the exact offset position you would like.

The floating module feature also allows a widget position to follow the users viewport.

### Parallax Background

![][parallax]

Parallax is apparent motion of a 3D object depending on your perspective. This effect has been transposed into the template, allowing configurable areas to move based on scroll position.
