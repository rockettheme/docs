### Responsive Layout

A responsive layout adapts automatically to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop, without the need for a separate layout or content. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. 960px and 1200px fixed layout options are also available.

| Label                  | Description                                | Layout Width     | Column Width |
| :----------            | :----------                                | :----------      | :----------  |
| Smartphones            | Standard smartphones                       | 480px and below  | 100% fluid   |
| Smartphones to Tablets | Larger smartphones and small tablets       | 767px and below  | 100% fluid   |
| Tablets                | Larger tablets                             | 768px and above  | 64px         |
| Desktop                | Standard desktops and laptops              | 960px and above  | 80px         |
| Large Display          | Large desktops and high-resolution laptops | 1200px and above | 100px        |

### Animation

The animated elements that trigger as you scroll down the page are handled via classes applied to modules. These classes are either included in the **Custom Variations** field or in-line in the content.

You can find a visual example as well as the class names of classes that are supported by Chimera [on the Animate.css project site](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).

The element that triggers this animation during scrolling is explained in greater detail in the [WOW.js Documentation](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/docs.html).
