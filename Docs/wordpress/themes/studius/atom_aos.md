AOS Atom
---------

<a href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/">Animation on Scroll</a> (AOS) is a small JS library that allows you to animate elements on your page as you scroll.

To initialize the library, go to your Base Outline > Page Settings and drag the Animate on Scroll atom into the dock. You can then save the Page Settings.

By clicking on the atom, you will find the Global settings to be used for your AOS elements:

AOS Attributes
---------
Once the atom is in place, you can now use the data-aos attributes within any of your HTML tags as shown here:

~~~ .html
<div data-aos="fade-up">Photo Centric Theme</div>
~~~

You can also set each elements duration and delay as shown here:

~~~ .html
<div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-duration="500">Focus</div>
~~~

The animation attributes can also be used within a Section / Block via the Tag Attribute option:
