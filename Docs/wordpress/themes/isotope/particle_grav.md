## Introduction

The **WordPress Content** particle (Also known as `contentarray`) gives you the ability to directly list and pull in WordPress posts directly from the CMS and present them in a clean, organized way. It's important to note this does not take the place of the **Page Content** particle which essentially displays any post content assigned to the page. This is a controlled, organized particle perfect for showcasing content.

### Main Options 

The particle's settings panel enables you to set exactly what content appears in the particle, and how it's presented. We have provided descriptions to the available options below.
