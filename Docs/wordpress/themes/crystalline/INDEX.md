![][color]

The Color Chooser is an interactive popup that allows you to edit the various style elements of Crystalline, such as background, text, link colour and overlay graphics, live. The transparent nature of the style perfectly complements this feature.

### Widget Style

There are 14 suffixes: bg1-5, title1-5, flush, flushtop, flushbottom & basic, a mix of stylistic suffixes, to adjust title/bg style and color, as well as structural suffixes. Widget Variations allow for the individual styling of each widget within a position, without it being global.
