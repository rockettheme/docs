### Background Picket

The Color Chooser system in Radiance benefits from a Background Picker, an administrative interface that allows for the selection of an image. You can choose between an image loaded from the Media Library or through RokGallery, searchable by either file or gallery.

### Custom Font

The richness of Radiance is composited in part from its prolific use of custom fonts for varying title elements, ranging from content articles to widget titles and textual elements in the various extensions such as RokGallery; which adds character and uniqueness.
