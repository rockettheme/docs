## What is Gantry?

[Gantry][gantry] is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTheme theme. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of Grav.

## Can I install RocketLauncher onto an existing Grav! website?

No. RocketLauncher will install both Grav and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh Grav! installation.

## I installed Studius RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.

To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
