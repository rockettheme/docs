The **Feature List** particle is an excellent choice for any situation where you want to create a content block that lists features and other tidbits of featurelistrmation.

Here are the topics covered in this guide:

* [Configuration](#configuration)
    - [Main Options](#main-options)
    - [Item Options](#item-options)

## Configuration

### Main Options 

These options affect the main area of the particle, and not the individual items within. You can set the title of the particle, as well as give it an introductory paragraph here.
