The theme features a diverse collection of new particles, to enrich your site content. Xenon debuts Chartist, a visually stunning graphical chart display script, alongside the News Slider and News ticker particles, amongst several others.

## Responsive

Xenon is a responsive theme which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.

## Inheritance

Xenon takes full advantage of Gantry’s new inheritance system, making it easier than ever to configure and manage your website through synced particles, atoms, sections, and layouts. Save time by using inheritance to avoid repetitive changes!
