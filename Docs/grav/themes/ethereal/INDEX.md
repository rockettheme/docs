Ethereal's pre-built presets are displayed in the Styles tab for you to preview, individually customize and apply. You'll also find an assortment of individual style options, such as text and background colors for the various sections, allowing for easy color changes.

A responsive layout adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
