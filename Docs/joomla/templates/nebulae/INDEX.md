![][transparency]

Nebulae, combines visual sophistication with functionality and power. The template offers several stunning presets, with distinct color schemes complementing their detailed background counterparts, as amplified by the mainbody's high transparency.

### Scrolling Modules

![][scrolling]

Scrolling Positions is a Gantry feature, which, when activated, modifies the behavior of stacked modules. Instead of appearing vertically, the other modules become accessible via a button, e.g. More. The Content Top and Bottom position have this feature.
