Can I install RocketLauncher on existing Joomla! website?
-----
No. RocketLauncher will install both Joomla and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh Joomla! installation.

I installed Praxis RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.
-----
To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
