Can I install RocketLauncher onto an existing Joomla! website?
-----

No. RocketLauncher will install both Joomla and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh Joomla! installation.

I installed Vermilion RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.

To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
