### Color Chooser with Background Picker

![][color]

A Color Chooser template uses CSS color values, combined with transparent overlay images, to determine its color and style. Therefore, you can change the entire color scheme via the Gantry Administrator.

#### Background Picker

The Background Picker allows you to load a background image, either through RokGallery or the Joomla Media Manager.

* **Files Window**: View all individual images from RokGallery
