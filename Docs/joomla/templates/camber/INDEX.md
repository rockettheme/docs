### Triple SplitMenu

![][splitmenu]

There are two menu options, Triple Level SplitMenu and Fusion. The latter is a CSS based dropdown menu. Triple Level Splitmenu splits the first level, second level and all further menu items, allowing for for a navigation bar, a dropline and a sidemenu, as configurable.

### Compact Login

![][login]

A uniquely styled feature is the horizontal login in the header area. The styling is automatically applied, without the need for a module suffix, which transforms the vertical login module into a compact, singular lined login, perfect for displaying in space-conscious zones.
