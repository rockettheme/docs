## Introduction

The **Info List** particle is an excellent choice for any situation where you want to create a content block that lists features and other tidbits of information.

Here are the topics covered in this guide:

* [Configuration](#configuration)
    - [Main Options](#main-options)
    - [Item Options](#item-options)

## Configuration

### Main Options 

These options affect the main area of the particle, and not the individual items within. You can set the title of the particle, as well as give it an introductory paragraph here.

| Option      | Description                                                                     |
| :-----      | :-----                                                                          |
| CSS Classes | Set the CSS class(es) you would like to have apply at the particle level.       |
| Title       | Enter the title of the particle you would like to have appear on the front end. |
| Intro       | Enter introductory text for the particle. This appears below the title.         |
| Grid Column | Set the number of columns you want items to appear in.                          |

### Item Options

These items make up the individual featured items in the particle. They sit apart from the particle's title and introduction. Each item can have its own properties, including icons and written content.
