![][fusion]

Fusion is an advanced, CSS menu system, which offers a wide range of per menu options, such as: inline subtext, icons, modules, module positions, custom column widths and number, as well as control over how menu items are distributed between columns.

Reflex has a selection of custom overrides but most notable for the featured content component, where it has a left aligned, and side column-styled date and article info icons, such as print, to provide distinct visuals as compared to the standard Joomla layout.
