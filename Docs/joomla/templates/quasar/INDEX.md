Introduction
-----

Quasar is the first Free / GPL template released by RocketTheme to be built with the new Gantry Framework 2.0, that made its initial debut with Dominion Jan 10. With Gantry, Quasar becomes a very powerful and feature rich template, on an almost comparable level with our Club Templates, in terms of functionality.

In conjunction with Gantry, the other features such as a CSS dropdown menu and 6 style variations, amongst many others, make Quasar a useful, diverse and functional free template, great for any purpose.

### Gantry Framework

The most noticeable feature of Quasar is most certainly its incorporation of the new Gantry Framework. Gantry is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTheme template. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of Joomla. 

### CSS Dropdown Menu

Quasar is outfitted with custom styling for the Joomla main menu module. This styling, when the module is placed into the header positions, allows the menu to be transformed from a basic list to a dynamic, CSS dropdown menu.

### RTL Support

Template side RTL support such as the module styling and typography. This is in conjunction with Gantry version 2.0's RTL support for the automatic flipping of the grid system.

If Joomla is set to RTL mode, in its language settings, the Quasar template will automatically adjust to its RTL layout. The modules will invert inside a row, such as showcase-a and showcase-f being in alternate locations; the various template elements such as the breadcrumbs and typography will also flip; and also the menu will adjust accordingly (ensure you are using the latest version of RokNavMenu however).
