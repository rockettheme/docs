## Introduction

![](assets/particle_block1.png)

The **Block Content** particle is a great way to create a clean and simple content block with images and text. 

Here are the topics covered in this guide:

* [Configuration](#configuration)
    - [Main Options](#main-options)
    - [Item Options](#item-options)

## Configuration

### Main Options 

These options affect the main area of the particle, and not the individual items within. For example, if you want to display content that includes a title, headline, image, and link you can do so here, but if you want to display numerous individual items, each with their own text, images, and/or links, you can do so using the **Block Items** collection feature.

### Item Options

These items make up the individual featured items in the particle. They sit apart from the particle's title, headline, image, and description. Each item can have its own properties, including images and written content.
