### Gantry Framework

Grunge is the built with the [Gantry Framework][gantry], which includes powerful features such as menu item control, RTL support, custom presets and many more. This is all on top of the first generation features, making Gantry the most noticeable, and far reaching feature of the template.

Gantry is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTheme template. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of Joomla. 

### CSS Dropdown Menu

Grunge is outfitted with custom styling for the Joomla main menu module. This styling, when the module is placed into the header positions, allows the menu to be transformed from a basic list to a dynamic, CSS dropdown menu.

### RTL Support

Template side RTL support from the Fusion menu to the Typography. This is in conjunction with Gantry's RTL support for the automatic flipping of the grid system.

If Joomla is set to RTL mode, in its language settings, the Grunge template will automatically adjust to its RTL layout. The modules will invert inside a row, such as showcase-a and showcase-f being in alternate locations; the various template elements such as the breadcrumbs and typography will also flip; and also the menu will adjust accordingly.
