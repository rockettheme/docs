Introduction
-----
Kirigami, the August 2012 template release, is the first responsive RocketTheme template, built with the Gantry v3 Framework. A responsive design adapts itself to a particular viewing environment such as desktop or mobile, without the need for separate layouts for varying platforms.

### Responsive Layout
![][responsive]
Kirigami's responsive grid system is designed for desktop, tablet and smartphone systems, each with minor modifications to ensure compatibility in each mode.

We use the responsive layout based on Twitter's Bootstrap Framework, with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.

The table below shows the breakdown of screen resolutions and associated devices, and which layout characters are then applied to each.
