### RokGallery Powered Background Slideshow

Transform the entire template into a dynamic, configurable slideshow via the intuitive, user friendly RokGallery infrastructure. Use RoKGallery's slideshow to rotate between main background images.

### Color Chooser with Background Picker

A Color Chooser template uses CSS color values, combined with transparent overlay images, to determine its color and style. Therefore, you can change the entire color scheme via the Gantry Administrator.

#### Showcase Layout

The Background Picker allows you to load a background image, either through RokGallery or the Joomla Media Manager.
