What is SEO?
=====

SEO stands for Search Engine Customization, and constitutes virtually anything and everything having to do with making your site easier to find on search engines. This is done with the purpose in mind of increasing the volume and/or quality of traffic to the site.

Google, which currently holds market dominance in the world of Web search, frequently changes its algorithms to make its results more attuned to the needs of the user. Over the past several years, its search service has evolved to include social integration and email content analysis. If you're an Android or Google mobile application user, your habits and exact location can be used to better predict what exactly what you might be searching for. If you search "breakfast taco" on your phone from the corner of First and Main Street, your results might be different than they would be if you searched from the corner of Second and Elm. Why? Because, Google has a very advanced system in place to match each individual user to the right results.

The practice of SEO attempts to position your site and its content in a way that gives it the best chance possible to appear on the front page of search results for the right audience and with the right keywords.

A comprehensive SEO strategy includes a wide range of considerations including * Keyword Placement in Titles

* Keyword Placement in Content
* Article Length
* Tags
* Site Name Appearance
* Initial Paragraph Wording
* Social Integration
* Comment Moderation
* More

There are several steps you can take to improve your site's SEO aside from changing the content itself.

| Search Engine Friendly URLs      | URLs are rewritten to be more friendly for search engine spiders. |
| Use URL Rewriting                | Uses the mod_rewrite settings of Apache when creating SEF URLs.   |
| Adds Suffix to URL               | Adds .html to the end of URLs.                                    |
| Unicode Aliases                  | Allows non-Latin characters in title and URL.                     |
| Include Site Name in Page Titles | Appends the site name to all page titles.                         |

### Include Site Name in Page Titles
Including your site's name in page titles only impacts how the title appears in your browser's tab. As far as search engines go, it also adds a branding to search results. This enables people to quickly identify and select your site's article over any others that might appear in the page. It's a quick way around having to dig through the page description to find what you're looking for.

There's a downside with doing this. Your total SEF (Search Engine Friendly) title should be no more than 70 characters. If your site's brand is 10 characters with a space, dash, and a space separating it from the main title,  you'll need to account for 13 fewer characters in your individual article titles.

### Unicode Aliases
Unicode aliases are only really useful if you use non-Latin characters in your site or article titles. For example, if you use the Greek alphabet as part of your site's name, then you'll want to turn this feature on. Otherwise, it's probably best left off.

### Adds Suffix to URL

### Use URL Rewriting

### Search Engine Friendly URLs
This feature rewrites URLs in a way that makes it easier for someone to tell what the article is about by the URL alone. It's a useful strategy that has become part of several major search engine's ranking algorithms. If your site URLs aren't easy to understand, then there's probably less of a chance someone will click on them if it were passed on through Twitter or email.

Writing Tips and Strategies
-----
While the science of SEO changes regularly, there are a few tips that have endured over the years as good SEO practice. Here are a few tips to help you better position your site for search engine ranking.

### Keywords
Keywords are key. If you were searching for a how-to guide relating to setting up an Ikea desk, you'd probably type something like `How to Assemble Ikea Desks` into the search engine rather than a more perfectly formed sentence. In this case, you're using keywords to search for directions.

By titling your article, "How to Assemble Ikea Desks" rather than "Ikea Desk Assembly Directions", you're setting yourself up to receive more traffic.

Those keywords don't just extend to your title. You should use them no less than three times throughout your article. This is called keyword padding, and it allows the search engine to better relate your page's content to the subject the person is searching for. Here are a few examples of sentences that could be used to utilize those keywords in the content body of the article:

* Here's my guide on how to assemble Ikea desks.
* The most important thing to remember when you assemble Ikea desks is...
* That's all you need to do to properly assemble Ikea desks.

These phrases should be separated by at least 50-100 words, but they will make a difference on how search engines like Google and Yahoo rank your content.

### Article Length
There is a debate going on between SEO analysts concerning the recommended length of an article. Search engines tend to rank sites and content based on authority, and it's hard to believe they would treat a 100-word article the same way they would one with over 1,000 words.

In general, the first 300 words are believed to be what Google and Bing capture and store as part of the page's description in the absence of a defined one. It's this description potential visitors see in search results, and part of what search engines base the page's ranking on. These first 300 words should include keywords, a description of the content to follow, and a hook that capture's the reader's attention and makes them want to read more.

An article that's artificially pumped full of words can come across as cumbersome and dull. It's more important to have good content than to inflate your word count artificially. Consider article length as a goal and not a rule of thumb.
