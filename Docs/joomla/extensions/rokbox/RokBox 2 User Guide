# Introducing Rokbox 2
The More Ultimate Javascript Powered Multimedia Box   
RokBox2 is a fully responsive modal pop-up plug-in for Joomla. It displays images, videos, embedded widgets, Ajax content and Joomla modules.

RokBox2 contains a Content plug-in and Button Editor plug-in. The Content plug-in can auto-generate thumbnails of local images that can be used as content for your RokBox2 links. All thumbnails generated are responsive so that they can easily adapt to any device. The Button Editor plug-in allows for easy creation of RokBox2 style snippets with just a few clicks.

RokBox2 Auto generates thumbnails of local images that can be used as content for your RokBox2 links. All thumbnails generated are responsive so that they can be easily adapted to any device. RokBox2 Content plugins also provides backward compatibility for the old discontinued RokBox1 that allowed writing snippets through the {rokbox} syntax.
 
Djamil Legato's RokBox 2 improves on the original as now it comes with a Syntax Creator, for those who like less coding. So now the choice is yours, code your RokBox 2 statements or let the Syntax Creator do it for you. RokBox 2 is available for Joomla 2.5 and Joomla 3.0
