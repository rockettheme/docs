Introduction

![][rokpad]

Ever wished you could use a powerful desktop text editor such as Textmate, SublimeText, or UltraEdit directly on a Joomla! web site? Now with RokPad we provide many features and capabilities that traditionally would only be found in a powerful desktop editor. RokPad provides advanced functions such as an Ajax saving action, syntax highlighting, configurable themes, multiple cursors and selections, shortcut keys, multiple programming language support, and many other incredible features.

RokPad is not a WYSIWYG editor, instead it is a powerful desktop-style editor for developers. With RokPad creating content becomes a pleasure not a chore.
