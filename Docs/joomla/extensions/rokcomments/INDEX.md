Introduction
-----

![][featured]

RokComments is a complete rewrite of the ever-popular RokIntenseDebate plugin. We've added support for Disqus and JS-Kit, as well as the original IntenseDebate support. RokComments can be enabled via menu item, Joomla category, or even a RokComments editor button for complete control.

The RokComments plugin allows for easy integration of third-party JavaScript-based comment systems, such as: IntenseDebate, Facebook, Disqus, Livefyre, and JS-Kit.

Requirements
-----

RokAjaxSearch has the following requirements in order to operate:

* Joomla 2.5 or 3.x - ensure you are using the latest version.

>> NOTE: Internet Explorer 7 and before are not supported

>> NOTICE: RokComments requires Joomla SEF to be turned on for this plugin to function properly, and interact reliably with these comment systems. This is due to the comments being associated with the URL, and non-SEF URLs with and in them are truncated by these systems.
